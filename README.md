This Python code defines a class Solution with a method romanToInt that converts a Roman numeral represented as a string (s) to an integer. The Roman numerals are represented by the characters 'I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', and 'M', and each has a corresponding numeric value.

The algorithm iterates through the input string (s) and adds up the numeric values of the Roman numeral characters. However, if a smaller numeral appears before a larger numeral (e.g., 'IV' for 4 or 'IX' for 9), the algorithm adjusts the result by subtracting twice the value of the smaller numeral. This is because the smaller numeral is subtracted once when added, and then it needs to be subtracted again to account for the fact that it was added in the previous step.

Here's a brief overview of the key components:

symbol_value: A dictionary mapping Roman numeral characters to their corresponding numeric values.
result: An accumulator variable to keep track of the total numeric value.
prev_value: The value of the previous numeral in the iteration, used to determine whether subtraction is needed.
The loop iterates through each character in the input string, updates the result based on the rules mentioned, and returns the final calculated integer value.
